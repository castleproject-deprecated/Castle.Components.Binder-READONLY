Status of 1.0.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r2500
    Treat compiler warnings as errors, except for warning CS1591 ('Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member
	'Type_or_Member'') and a few very specific warnings in specific projects (DP2).
    On framework 2.0 it will throw ConfigurationErrorsException instead of the deprecated ConfigurationException. This is a
	breaking change.
    In general all deprecated code is modified to compile without warnings on 2.0.

  * r2504,2543
    Applied (with reformatting) patch by William C. Pierce <wcpierce@gmail.com> adding PerWebRequestAttribute
	Notes:
      The change in 2504 fails the build because of a missing file, 2543 corrects this.

    Votes:
       +1: roelofb
	   -1: hammett (we have not tested it)
	   -1: hconceicao (not tested, it isn't a demand)
	   
  * r2512
    Put a link to CastleKey.snk in VS2005 projects.
	Trunk version of patch:
      http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/castleproject/?cs=2512
	Justification:
	It's part of the 'productizing' of this branch: make a good user experience. If the projects are complete and compile
	right away in Studio it'll make us look good.

	Trunk version of patch:
     http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/castleproject/?cs=2623
	Justification:
	A simpler way to perform pagination with complex data, generated
	from an HQL query.

       -1: hammett (not documented)

  * r2778
    Fixed a bug in the System.Net.Mail (.NET 2.0) version of the SmtpSender, regarding empty CC and BCC fields.
    Also added some new configurable functionality for .NET 2.0:
      Ability to send emails asyncronously (AsyncSend property);
      Configurable SMTP port (Port property);
      Configurable timeout for syncronous send (Timeout property);

  Votes:
       +1: fabiob
       -1: hammett (this SmtpSender should not be a separated project, we need to merge them)


  * r2780
    Proposed fix for IOC-33.
  Trunk version of patch:
    http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/castleproject/?cs=2780
  Justification:
    IOC-33 was about exceptions thrown by MarshalByRefObject proxies
    losing their stack traces. I'm not sure of the side-effects
    of the fix, thought.
  Votes:
       +1: fabiob (althrough I'm not sure if it is the best fix, it's better than what the previous code)
       -1: hammett (lets test it then)

  * r2787,2791
    Fixing IoC-34 - the check made will be a stricter one, including the method that is requested as well.
